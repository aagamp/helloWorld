# type casting is the process of converting one data type into another data type is called type casting.Here is the program

age = 17
gpa = 3.65
name = "sara"
students = True

#print(type(age))
#print(type(gpa))
#print(type(name))
#print(type(students))

age = float(age)
print(type(age))

gpa = int(gpa)
print(type(gpa))

name = bool(name)
print(type(name))

students = str(students)
print(type(students))
